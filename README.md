# 3DShading
A 3D ray tracing demo written in C++. Basic imlementations of ray casting, specular high light, texture mapping, relection/refraction and shadow casting. 
Objects covered: sphere/sky box, plane, triangular mesh obj files. 
For now there's no parallel programming, the whole program runs on a single thread with heavy loops.

Libraries used: openGL, glm, nupengl, freeimage, code from ShenyaoKe/VIZA654 project for image operation.

All modules written from scratch using only openGL's vector and matrix operations and GLUT library.
